# Wisal Platform Audit Report
**Date:** January 19, 2025  
**Status:** Platform Running with Critical Issues

## Executive Summary

The Wisal platform is currently running via Docker Compose with all services operational. However, there are several critical issues that need immediate attention before the platform can be considered production-ready.

## ðŸŸ¢ Working Components

1. **Docker Infrastructure**
   - All services are running successfully
   - Health checks are passing
   - Proper service dependencies configured
   - Development tools included (Mongo Express, Kibana, RedisInsight)

2. **Authentication System**
   - LinkedIn OAuth properly implemented
   - JWT authentication working
   - Passport.js configured correctly

3. **Database Layer**
   - MongoDB running with authentication
   - Redis for sessions operational
   - Elasticsearch for search ready

4. **Basic Application Structure**
   - Backend API running on port 3001
   - Frontend React app running on port 3000
   - WebSocket support via Socket.io

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

### 1. **Security - Exposed API Keys**
- **Location:** `/Users/raihaan/DD-25/.env`
- **Issue:** Production API keys are exposed in root .env file
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - Keys could be compromised
- **Action Required:** Immediately rotate all API keys and remove from version control

### 2. **AI Integration Not Connected**
- **Issue:** AI routes exist but are not mounted in server.ts
- **Impact:** Core functionality (legal query matching) is non-functional
- **Fix:** Add `app.use('/api/ai', aiRoutes);` to server.ts

### 3. **Database Schema Mismatch**
- **MongoDB Init Script:** Generic schema doesn't match PRD requirements
- **User Model:** Missing 'activist' role and authProvider field
- **Models:** LawyerProfile, SeekerProfile, LegalQuery differ from PRD specs
- **Impact:** Data integrity issues and feature incompleteness

### 4. **Missing RBAC Implementation**
- **PRD Requirement:** Role-based access control with permissions
- **Current State:** Basic role field exists, no permissions system
- **Impact:** Admin features non-functional

### 5. **Port Configuration Mismatch**
- **PRD Specifies:** Backend on port 4000
- **Current Config:** Backend on port 3001
- **Impact:** Documentation inconsistency

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues

1. **Admin Endpoints Missing**
   - Routes defined but controllers not implemented
   - Frontend expects these endpoints

2. **Environment Files Missing**
   - Backend and Frontend missing actual .env files
   - Only .env.example files present

3. **Search Integration Incomplete**
   - Elasticsearch running but not integrated with queries

4. **File Upload Storage**
   - Local volumes configured but no cloud storage setup

## ðŸ“‹ Action Items (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Before Any Deployment):
1. **Remove exposed API keys from root .env file**
2. **Rotate all compromised API keys**
3. **Create proper .env files for backend/frontend**
4. **Connect AI routes in server.ts**

### High Priority:
1. **Fix User model to match PRD**
   - Add 'activist' role
   - Add authProvider field
   - Rename firstName/lastName to name

2. **Update MongoDB init script**
   - Match PRD schema requirements
   - Add proper collections for Wisal

3. **Implement RBAC system**
   - Create Role and Permission models
   - Add permission checking middleware

### Medium Priority:
1. **Standardize port configuration**
2. **Implement admin endpoints**
3. **Integrate Elasticsearch**
4. **Complete AI integration testing**

## ðŸš€ Docker Commands

```bash
# Current status (all services running)
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend

# Restart services
docker-compose restart backend

# Access MongoDB
docker exec -it wisal-mongodb mongosh -u admin -p

# Access Redis
docker exec -it wisal-redis redis-cli -a changeme
```

## ðŸ“Š Service URLs

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001
- MongoDB Express: http://localhost:8081
- Kibana: http://localhost:5601
- RedisInsight: http://localhost:8001

## âœ… Recommendations

1. **Immediate Security Fix**: Remove and rotate exposed API keys
2. **Enable Core Features**: Connect AI routes to enable legal matching
3. **Data Model Alignment**: Update models to match PRD specifications
4. **Complete Admin Features**: Implement missing admin functionality
5. **Production Readiness**: Add SSL, email service, and monitoring

## Conclusion

The Wisal platform has a solid foundation with all services running successfully. However, critical security issues and missing core functionality (AI integration) must be addressed before the platform can serve its intended purpose. The exposed API keys pose an immediate security risk that requires urgent attention.

**Overall Readiness: 65%** - Functional infrastructure with critical gaps in implementation and security.
