# Information Architecture

# **Landing page:**

Top navigation should link to “Find Legal Help” and “Activism Hub”. For a user that is logged in, across the whole site there will be an envelope icon in the banner that will take them to chat. The chat interface is also where the user will receive key admin updates e.g. “your profile has been approved”

Below the links there should be 3 cards articulating the key benefits or features of our solution (please pick 3 of the ones already created or merge some if that makes more sense). Please do not refer to the service being “free” as we cannot confirm no lawyers will charge at all for their service, depending on the nature of the help being requested.

The primary calls to action (CTAs) should be Join/sign up, login & search. 

Search is to be a free-text box with the title “Request advice from a legal professional” with the AI engine look and feel, with the opportunity to respond back to the AI agent with more clarity and information as required. 3 top search results should appear, for guest users these will be blurred cards with guidance to say “we have found some professionals matching your criteria, login or sign up to view your search results”. If the cards can have an animation as they appear that would be nice to have.

# **Sign up:**

3 stage process, so split by 3 pages

## Step 1

Title is “Sign up”, with copy underneath saying “Join Wisal today to connect with legal professionals who specialise in helping those seeking justice as part of the Palestinian cause”

User provides their name, email address and password. They then confirm their password.

CTAs are to login or “login with LinkedIn”

There is a progress bar across the top above the input fields

## Step 2

Step 2 on the progress bar, again the page has the title “Sign up”, with copy under saying “I am…”

Two buttons:

- seeking legal advice, clicking navigates to Step 3A
- a legal professional, clicking navigates to Step 3B

## Step 3

Step 3 on the progress bar. 

### Step 3A

Title is “Sign up as an advice seeker”, and any fields that were populated as they linked their LinkedIn profile are auto-populated but editable.

Fields for an advice seeker are:

- Occupation*
- Location, with the option to lookup their current location but only populate the postcode*
- Description of help required (larger text box)*
- Category dropdown
- Is the advice you require related to an ongoing case? (Yes or No as radio buttons)*
- “Sign up” CTA

Text under this will say “By progressing you consent to the terms and conditions”, which will eventually link out to T&Cs.

### Step 3B

Step 3 on the progress bar. Title is “Sign up as a legal professional”, and any fields that were populated as they linked their LinkedIn profile are auto-populated but editable.

Fields for a legal professional are (mandatory marked with *):

- Current role and employer*
- Location, with the option to lookup their current location but only populate the postcode*
- Legal specialism tags* (can select multiple)

- Qualified since*
- Credentials (document upload)
- Certified body registration number
- Languages
- Availability (opens calendar view)
- “Sign up” CTA

Text under this will say “By progressing you consent to the terms and conditions”, which will eventually link out to T&Cs.

The user on pressing “sign up” will be navigated to a “pending approval” page, and will be instructed to keep an eye on their inbox and we will endeavour to get back to them within 24 hours.

# Search:

This will be a full screen view for the user who presses “Find Help” in the website navigation bar, this will not be behind a login, but the search results will be blurred for a guest user and visible upon signup or login.

Title is “Request advice from a legal professional”

Please describe the matter you would like assistance with, followed by a free text box. User inputs their query and presses “search”. The engine either returns results or requests clarification and the user inputs additional information. 

Once the search is successful, 3 top search results that best match the requirements from the user will be surfaced as cards. The cards will contain:

- Name
- Occupation
- Specialism
- Location (x miles away)

Tapping into a card will unlock a full profile view that contains the data the user signed up with (without contact details available). From the profile view the user can opt to “chat” with the legal professional.

# Chat:

Incoming chat requests for a legal professional will start with a summary card of the user’s request for legal help. The professional will have the option to accept or decline the request, and upon accepting the chat function will be enabled.
