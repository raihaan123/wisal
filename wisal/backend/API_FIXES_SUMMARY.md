# API Endpoint Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 404 Error on Lawyer Listing Endpoint
**Problem**: Frontend was calling `/api/lawyers` but backend route was `/api/lawyers/search`

**Solution**: Updated `lawyerService.ts` to use the correct endpoint:
```typescript
// Before
const response = await api.get(`/lawyers?${params}`)

// After  
const response = await api.get(`/lawyers/search?${params}`)
```

### 2. Response Format Mismatch
**Problem**: Backend was returning raw LawyerProfile documents, but frontend expected User objects with nested lawyerProfile

**Solution**: Created a transformer in `/backend/src/utils/transformers.ts` to convert backend format to frontend expectations:
- Maps LawyerProfile fields to User object structure
- Properly nests lawyerProfile data
- Handles field name differences (e.g., specialisms â†’ specializations)
- Adds missing fields with defaults

### 3. Missing consultationTypes Field
**Problem**: Frontend expected consultationTypes array but it wasn't in the mock data

**Solution**: 
- Added consultationTypes to seed script
- Updated transformer to handle both consultationTypes and consultationMethods fields

## Current API Response Format

The `/api/lawyers/search` endpoint now returns:
```json
{
  "lawyers": [
    {
      "id": "userId",
      "email": "lawyer@example.com",
      "name": "Lawyer Name",
      "role": "lawyer",
      "lawyerProfile": {
        "specializations": ["Immigration Law"],
        "location": { "city": "New York", "state": "NY", "country": "USA" },
        "consultationTypes": ["chat", "video", "phone"],
        // ... other fields
      }
    }
  ],
  "total": 5,
  "totalPages": 1,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 20
}
```

## Testing

Test the endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/lawyers/search | jq '.'
```

## Next Steps

All other frontend endpoints should be verified to ensure they match backend routes:
- Check consultation endpoints
- Verify authentication endpoints  
- Test user profile endpoints
- Validate AI search endpoints
