# OAuth Callback Fix Summary

## Problem
The LinkedIn OAuth callback was hanging on the loading screen even though tokens were successfully passed in the URL parameters.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `/auth/OAuthCallback.tsx`:
```javascript
// This doesn't work - direct assignment doesn't trigger Zustand state updates
authStore.token = token
```

Zustand requires using `setState` to properly update the store and trigger re-renders.

## Solution
Replace direct property assignment with proper state update:
```javascript
// Correct way to update Zustand store
useAuthStore.setState({ token, isAuthenticated: false, isLoading: true })

// Then call checkAuth to fetch user data
await authStore.checkAuth()
```

## What Happens Now
1. User authorizes with LinkedIn
2. LinkedIn redirects to `/auth/callback` with tokens
3. Tokens are stored in localStorage
4. Tokens are properly set in Zustand store using setState
5. checkAuth() reads the token from store and fetches user data
6. User is redirected to dashboard

## Testing
1. Clear browser storage (localStorage and cookies)
2. Try LinkedIn login again
3. Check browser console for debug logs
4. Should redirect to dashboard after successful auth
