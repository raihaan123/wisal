# LinkedIn OAuth Fix - Complete Solution

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Infinite Loop in useEffect**
- **Problem**: The original `authStore` object was in the useEffect dependencies, causing infinite re-renders
- **Solution**: Removed all dependencies from useEffect to ensure it only runs once

### 2. **API Interceptor Redirect Loop**
- **Problem**: The axios interceptor was redirecting to `/login` on 401 errors, even from the callback page
- **Solution**: Added check to prevent redirects when already on auth pages

### 3. **Zustand State Update Issue**
- **Problem**: Direct assignment `authStore.token = token` doesn't trigger state updates
- **Solution**: Use `useAuthStore.setState()` to properly update the store

### 4. **Race Condition with checkAuth**
- **Problem**: `checkAuth` was called before the token was properly set in the store
- **Solution**: Set token in store first, then fetch user data directly

## Final Implementation

The OAuth callback now:
1. Stores tokens in localStorage
2. Updates Zustand store using `setState`
3. Fetches user data directly
4. Handles errors gracefully without causing loops
5. Uses `replace: true` on navigation to prevent back button issues
6. Has proper loading states

## Testing Instructions

1. Clear all browser storage (localStorage, cookies)
2. Go to LinkedIn login: `http://localhost:4000/api/auth/linkedin-custom`
3. Authorize with LinkedIn
4. Should redirect to dashboard without hanging

## Key Code Changes

1. **OAuthCallback.tsx**: Complete rewrite with proper state management
2. **api.ts**: Added auth page check in interceptor
3. **auth.ts routes**: Added debug endpoint for troubleshooting

## If Issues Persist

1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Check backend logs for OAuth flow details
3. Verify LinkedIn app settings match local configuration
4. Try in incognito mode to rule out cache issues
